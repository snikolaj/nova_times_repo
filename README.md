This is a repository containing the editions of the high school newspaper that I designed between 2021 and 2023.

The layout and design was made in Adobe InDesign. The first editions use a similar design, while the last edition (11th) has an updated and improved modern design. In my opinion, there is a clear progression in the design between consecutive editions. I also wrote a few articles in some of the editions, and took photos for the others. In total, the school newspaper was a great experience for me.
